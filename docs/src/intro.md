# Introduction

**Flamingo is compiler and runtime for ALM[[1](#1)], a DSL for describing state
machines in an ultra-compact way, emphasizing simplicity, modularity, and
correctness.** 

Flamingo is built with web apps in mind and ~~compiles to efficient, portable
javascript~~ is interpreted by a WebAssembly backend [[2](#2)]. Flamingo programs
handle _state management_ - you can think of Flamingo as DSL for writing
Redux reducers. Hook up browser events to Flamingo's runtime, bind state changes
to the DOM as views with, e.g., React, and _voilÃ _! you have a web app!

The ALM language is designed for _commonsense reasoning about real-world
problems_. Using a few simple but powerful constructs from logic, ALM allows
us to express _pure business logic_, free from the incidental complexity of
algorithms. As a logic programming system, Flamingo trades performance for
expressiveness. Flamingo programs can be much slower than their imperative
counterparts; however, they are often orders of magnitude less overall code.
At the same time, ALM is carefully limited in its expressiveness compared to other
logic programming systems, always favoring simplicity and maintainability over
terseness and higher-orderedness.

Incidentally, these same limits allow Flamingo's
runtime to take advantage of decades of optimization research in the fields of
Datalog and ASP. Combined with Flamingos' automatic verification, these
characteristics make Flamingo ideal for the rapid design and implementation of
complex, practical systems.

In terms of language theory, ALM is a _logic programming language_, specifically
an extension of [Datalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog) that adds an explicit
notion of action and change, negative constraints, and a powerful, object-oriented module
system[[3](#3)].

## Installing the Compiler

You can install the Flamingo Compiler from NPM:
```
npm i -g flamingo-lang
```
    
## A Little Example

Here's a small example that models menus that can open and close.
```alm
module menu
sorts
    menu :: universe
        attributes
            title : string
            text : string
actions
    menu_action :: action
        target : menu
    open_menu :: menu_action
    close_menu :: menu_action
fluents
    basic
        open : menu -> booleans
axioms
    occurs(A) causes open(Menu) if
        instance(A, open_menu),
        target(A) = Menu.

    occurs(A) causes open(Menu) if
        instance(A, open_menu),
        target(A) = Menu.
```

Obviously, ALM's syntax is quite different from imperative
or functional languages; however, it's ultimately much simpler - even
this small example covers the majority of it. We'll cover the syntax
in depth in the coming sections. But first, let's discuss the motivation
behind the language: the tar pit of modern software development.

----------------
[<a name="1">1</a>]: ALM is the "Action Language with Modules", first described in
[this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05022) by Daniela Inclezan and Michael Gelfond.
It is the successor to AL, which comes from a long line of research on reasoning about
actions and change beginning with John McCarthy's
[situation calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_calculus) in 1975.

[<a name="2">2</a>]: The Flamingo-to-JS is a work in progress. For now, Flamingo is translated
into ASP and interpreted by the [Clingo solver](https://github.com/domoritz/clingo-wasm).

[<a name="3">3</a>]: Flamingo is a mostly-faithful Javascript implementation of the
[Modular Action Language ALM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05022), a specification language
with a rich history beginning with John McCarthy's
[situation calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_calculus).
